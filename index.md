## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs
* Lab 5 Part 2

  This was my favorite lab because we had to use two different data types, int and double, to convert inches decimal in feet form to feet and inches. It was rather confusing to start at first. This one took computer science to create a function that makes a mathematical computation easier. We also had to create a loop statement that took in account the negative values in order for the function to be read properly.

* Lab 7

  Lab 7 introduced using bool commands and returning the true or false statements. This was one of my favorite labs because we had to carefully write the numbers of the code so that it was accurate to each different street time and day. With the days it was fairly simple. The hours, however, were a little harder since one of the days was not the whole hour. For this we had to use the “&&” to make sure the input stayed within the time frame.

* Lab 9

  Both part 1 and 2 of this lab was one of my favorite labs because despite being the lab I had spent the longest time working on outside of class, I learned how to use the I/O file streams using two different functions to create a fun guessing game and read a file to correct the file. I was able to write the function for the spelling functions to accurately read the imported txt files and learned how to use the double vectors to do so. For part 2, I had some trouble using the file.good command the second time and the function would not return the right statement. After much deliberation I had decided to replace that line and it ended up working!
